# CORDIS review

Review this workspace against **A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal
Composability** (Shi, Zhang, Cui; [arXiv:2608.25512](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512))
and **implement every applicable fix**. Report-only is failure. Skip a finding
only when the paper's own system-boundary argument says the effect cannot be
tracked.

**This file is the checklist — start here.** It is the operational form of
the paper and is sufficient to review and patch; the agent is not required to
fetch anything before auditing.

Paper fetch, if you want the abstract and exact metadata: the **abs page only**
— <https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512> (HTTP 200). Do **not** try the PDF
(`/pdf/2608.25512`: this harness rejects `application/pdf`) or an HTML
rendering (`/html/2608.25512v1` is 404 — no HTML is published for this
submission). The abstract is not the checklist: rules come from this file, not
from a fetched page, and never from memory. The `§` numbers below are cited
from the paper's section structure and were verified against it; do not
re-derive or second-guess them mid-review.

If the workspace is DeepSeek Harness or a `dsh-*` plugin, also obey that
repo's Cordis conventions (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/cordis-primer.md`,
`docs/cordis-tutorial/`). The paper wins on the model; the repo wins on
names (`ctx.effect`, `inject`, `ctx.get`, `apply`).

## Protocol

1. **Scope.** Default: the current workspace. A `/cordis-review <path>`
   argument, if present, is the root. Do not wander into unrelated checkouts.
2. **Get the rules.** Read this file's **Checklist** and **What the paper
   requires** sections — that is the complete rubric, already loaded. If you
   need the paper's abstract or exact metadata, `web_fetch` the abs page
   `https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512` (the only URL that works; the PDF is
   rejected and there is no HTML rendering). In DSH / `dsh-*` plugin
   workspaces, also read that repo's `AGENTS.md` and `docs/cordis-primer.md`;
   those are the local naming and convention source of truth.
3. **Map the runtime.** Find the context object, effect/coeffect primitives,
   component/plugin entrypoints (`apply` / `inject` / `Service`), and the
   loader. In DSH/Cordis that is `ctx`, `ctx.effect` / `ctx.on` / `ctx.set`,
   `inject`, fibers, and the Loader.
4. **Closed-form pass.** Run this plugin's checker before walking the rest of
   the checklist. From this package root:

   ```
   node --experimental-strip-types --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning src/cli.ts [scope]
   ```

   The package root is the parent of `skills/cordis-review/` (this skill's
   directory). It prints `file:line: tag: message` for `mix-export`, `inject`,
   `toplevel`, and `id` — every tag is one ast-grep query. Without `ast-grep`
   on PATH each covered file warns on stderr and yields an LLM-fallback hit:
   judge that file against the checklist yourself (that is the fallback, not a
   second scanner). Zig has no ast-grep grammar, so `.zig` always takes that
   path. `leak` / `inverse` / `hmr` / `boundary` stay judgment.
   `cordis-check: clean` still means walk the checklist.
5. **Audit, then fix.** Walk the checklist below. Each hit is a code change
   unless it is a documented outside-boundary emission. Grep callers of every
   function you touch; fix the shared primitive, not one call site.
6. **Verify.** One HMR/dispose test per registration you add or repair: dispose
   the contributing fiber, assert the contribution is gone. Run the smallest
   existing test command that covers the files you changed. Re-run the checker.

## What the paper requires

Two orthogonal properties, local to one component, then lifted to a system of
interleaved components:

- **Temporal composability.** Every context mutation carries an inverse the
  runtime holds. Unload runs those inverses LIFO. A leftover timer, listener,
  registry row, or published service after dispose is a bug.
- **Spatial composability.** A component declares what it requires
  (coeffects). The runtime classifies every context change against that
  declaration and activates or deactivates the component. A missing provider
  leaves it inactive; it does not crash, and it does not reach around the
  declaration.

The **context paradigm** mediates every effect and coeffect through one
context. Reaching another component's context through a closure, import, or
global leaks effects out of the owner's lifecycle and coeffects out of its
`inject` list.

The runtime does **not** prove that an inverse actually reverts, or that
operations published at one key commute. Those are author obligations
(§5.1.1 effect tracking — "Effect tracking" is the only context-transformation
primitive, and the runtime does not check the inverse witness; §6.1 "System
Boundary"). This review discharges them in code.

## Checklist

One line per finding in the report, then the patch.

### Temporal — revertible effects

- `leak:` side effect not installed through the context (`setInterval`,
  `addEventListener`, `on()`, `fetch` abort, file watch, process, mutex,
  module-level singleton mutation). Wrap in `ctx.effect(() => { …; return dispose })`
  or the helper that already does (`ctx.on`, `register()` that returns a
  disposer).
- `inverse:` dispose does not restore the pre-effect state, is not idempotent,
  or is not LIFO with sibling effects. Inverse fires at most once.
- `toplevel:` work at module load (register, listen, I/O, `new Service`)
  instead of inside `apply(ctx)` / the Service constructor. Move it.
- `double:` dispose path can run the inverse twice, or never. Guard like
  Cordis `armed`.
- `foreign-ctx:` effect installed on a context that is not `fiber.ctx`
  (captured parent, global, another plugin's `ctx`). Install on the owner.

### Spatial — reactive coeffects

- `inject:` required service used as `ctx.foo` without `inject: ['foo']`.
  Declare it. Optional services use `ctx.get('foo')`, never the proxy.
- `bypass:` dependency reached by import, global, or hard-coded singleton
  instead of the context key. Route through `ctx`.
- `provide:` published service / registry row not a tracked effect
  (`ctx.set`, `ctx.plugin`, `register` returning a disposer). Make it one.
- `mix-export:` default-export Service **and** named `apply`/`inject` on the
  same module. Loader keeps one form; mixing drops `inject`. Pick one.
- `react:` component assumes a coeffect is eternal. It must survive provider
  swap / withdraw (stay inactive until the key returns; do not throw in
  `apply` for a missing optional).

### Context paradigm

- `mediate:` shared mutable environment written outside `ctx` (process global,
  imported registry, `window.*`, file side-channel used as a bus). Put it on
  a service key.
- `config:` runtime behavior that belongs in the component's `config` /
  Loader entry is a magic constant or env read inside `apply`. Bind config;
  invalid values fail at load, not later.
- `isolate:` cross-plugin state sharing that should be a realm (`isolate`)
  or a declared service, implemented as a module singleton.

### System boundary (§6.1)

- **Inside:** exclusive and restorable → must be a tracked effect.
- **Outside:** cannot restore (bytes already on the wire, other processes
  writing the file) → do not fake an inverse. Either **withhold** until
  commit or **compensate** with an application-level undo, and say so in a
  one-line comment (`cordis-boundary: emission, compensate by X`).
- `boundary:` treats an inside location as outside (leaks) **or** invents a
  "cleanup" for an emission it cannot revert (lies). Fix the classification.

### Lifecycle / loader

- `fiber:` retains a child plugin / subscription past owner dispose.
  Keep the fiber and dispose it in the owner's effect.
- `hmr:` registration has no dispose-the-fiber test. Add one.
- `id:` duplicate Loader `id` / plugin name, or a bundle patch that `insert`s
  the same row the profile already has.

## DSH / Cordis names

Map paper → this stack without renaming the stack:

| Paper | Code |
|---|---|
| context Γ | `ctx` |
| revertible effect | `ctx.effect`, `ctx.on`, `register()` → disposer |
| coeffect declaration | `export const inject = ['…']` |
| coeffect read | `ctx.foo` (required) / `ctx.get('foo')` (optional) |
| coeffect provide | `ctx.set` / Service constructor key |
| component | `export function apply(ctx)` or `class extends Service` |
| fiber | return value of `ctx.plugin(…)` |
| inverse accumulator | `fiber.dispose` |
| loader entry | `cordis.yml` / `cordis.patch.yml` row |

Harness conventions that already encode the paper: registrations are
effects; `ctx.get` for optional services; function plugins named-export
`name` / `inject` / `Config` / `apply` with **no** default export; every
registry has an HMR-safety test.

## Fixes

- Smallest change that restores the invariant. Deletion over a new
  abstraction. No "lifecycle manager" class for one timer.
- Do not add a framework, a second context type, or a compatibility shim.
- Do not rewrite working Cordis usage into a parallel effect system.
- Leave theory, proofs, and comments that are not lying. Code only.
- If a hit is outside this workspace (vendored Cordis, another repo), record
  it as `out-of-scope:` and do not patch it.

## Report (after the patches)

```
CORDIS review — arXiv:2608.25512
scope: <root>
fixed:
- <file>:<line>: <tag> <what>. <what you did>.
skipped:
- <file>:<line>: <tag> <what>. <why: boundary | out-of-scope | already-correct>
```

No essay. Empty `fixed` with empty `skipped` means you looked and the
workspace already holds the invariants — say that in one line.
